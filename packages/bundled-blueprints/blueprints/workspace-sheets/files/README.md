## Using the spreadsheet

- Click a cell to select it. Click a row or column header to select the whole row or column; Shift-click another header to extend a contiguous selection. Cmd-click on macOS or Ctrl-click on Windows/Linux to add non-adjacent cells, rows, or columns. Choosing a row or column header drops any individual-cell ranges while retaining other whole-row or whole-column selections.
- Double-click a cell, press **F2**, or begin typing to edit it. Drag the small handle at the selection’s bottom-right to fill neighboring rows or columns; copied formulas adjust relative references while `$A$1`, `$A1`, and `A$1` preserve their absolute column and/or row components.
- HTTP/HTTPS values are displayed as links. Cmd/Ctrl-click a link to open it, or right-click for **Open link** and **Copy link**. Use `=HYPERLINK("https://example.com","Example")` for custom link text.
- While building a formula, click or drag cells to insert a live cell/range reference without leaving the editor. All currently referenced cells are highlighted; clicking an already-selected individual reference toggles it out of aggregate functions such as SUM and AVERAGE, preventing duplicate point selections. Clicking within the formula bar immediately synchronizes its caret and selection with the in-cell editor. Clicking an existing highlighted reference activates that whole reference for resizing; a normal click elsewhere replaces the active reference. Only typing a comma or using Cmd-click on macOS / Ctrl-click on Windows/Linux adds another reference such as `C3, C5`; Shift extends the current range. Click row or column headers for full-row/full-column ranges, or use Arrow keys and Shift+Arrow to select and extend references. Arrow keys pick references after you type an operator, `(` or `,`; when editing an existing formula they move the caret. Place the caret within a specific range endpoint and use the toolbar **$** control or Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L to cycle only that reference through `A1`, `$A$1`, `A$1`, and `$A1`. Typing `(` at the end of the text inserts a pair, missing closing parentheses are completed on submission, and unmatched or missing required parentheses keep the editor open.
- Formula error cells provide hover diagnostics with a likely cause and highlight the suspicious formula segment when it can be identified.
- Start formulas with `=`, for example:
  - `=SUM(A1:A10)`
  - `=IF(B2>100,"High","Low")`
  - `=VLOOKUP(E2,A2:C20,3,FALSE)` (`TRUE` and `FALSE` are accepted as logical values without parentheses)
  - `=COUNTIF(A2:A20,'Complete')` (single-quoted text is accepted in addition to double quotes)
  - `=Sheet2!A1*2`
- Use the name box to jump to a cell or range such as `D12` or `A1:C8`.
- Use the filter toolbar button to detect the current data table automatically. The app identifies the likely header row (including tables below a title row) and adds dropdowns only to columns containing data. Selecting a range first explicitly sets the filter range and its top row as the header.
- Highlight a data range and use the chart toolbar button to create a line, pie, area, or stacked bar chart. The right-side settings panel controls chart type, range, titles, headers, labels, and legend; it can be collapsed at any time. Drag a chart by its header to reposition it. **Copy SVG** copies the chart as an SVG image, which some destinations (such as Google Slides) do not accept.
- Select a cell and use the comment toolbar button or right-click → **Comment** to add a comment in place. Comment markers reveal text on hover. The layered right sidebar shows top-level **Charts**, **Pivot tables**, and **Comments** destinations when available, with back navigation into their lists and details.
- Select a table including its header row and use the pivot toolbar button or right-click → **Create pivot table**. The result is generated on a new sheet with distinct pivot styling and automatically sized columns; configure row, column, value, aggregation, and optional multi-value filters from the Pivot tables section of the sidebar.
- Right-click the grid for cut/copy/paste, **Paste without formatting**, and row or column actions. Menu paste works for cells copied or cut inside the spreadsheet; browser security requires Ctrl/Cmd+V for content copied from another application. Pasted blocks expand from the active cell, repeat across compatible selected ranges, preserve internal formatting when requested, adjust copied relative formulas, and move cells only after an internal cut is pasted (into a single range); a cut pastes once. A whole-row copy pasted into column A replaces the destination rows entirely (a whole-column copy pasted into row 1, the columns). Press Escape to abandon a pending cut.
- Double-click a sheet tab to rename it; right-click it to duplicate or delete it.

## Programmatic population

The spreadsheet can be read and populated through the Gadget's server RPC methods. This is useful for scripts, agents, migrations, or seeding a workbook without using the grid UI.

### Read the workbook

Call `getDocument()` to retrieve the complete persisted workbook:

```js
const doc = await gadget.getDocument();
```

The returned object contains `revision`, `title`, `sheetOrder`, `sheets`, `cells`, and `lastModified`. Cells are grouped by sheet ID and keyed by A1 reference:

```js
const firstSheetId = doc.sheetOrder[0];
const a1 = doc.cells[firstSheetId].A1;
// { value: "Revenue", fmt: { b: true }, version: 1 }
```

### Write cells

Use `applyOperation()` with per-cell operations. For a new cell, use `baseVersion: 0`; when replacing or deleting an existing cell, use its current `version` from `getDocument()`.

```js
const doc = await gadget.getDocument();
const sheetId = doc.sheetOrder[0];
const cells = doc.cells[sheetId];

const result = await gadget.applyOperation({
  senderId: "seed-script",
  cellOps: [
    {
      sheetId,
      ref: "A1",
      value: "Revenue",
      fmt: { b: true, bg: "#fff3a3" },
      baseVersion: cells.A1?.version ?? 0,
    },
    {
      sheetId,
      ref: "B1",
      value: "=SUM(B2:B10)",
      fmt: { nf: "currency", d: 2 },
      baseVersion: cells.B1?.version ?? 0,
    },
  ],
});
```

A cell's `value` is always stored as text. Begin a value with `=` to create a formula. To delete a cell completely, send both `value: null` and `fmt: null` with the current `baseVersion`.

Check `result.status` after writing. It is `applied`, `unchanged`, `conflict`, or `rejected`. On a conflict, inspect `result.conflicts`, re-read the document, and retry against the latest cell versions rather than overwriting blindly. A `rejected` operation wrote nothing: `result.reason` is `stale` (a sheet replacement's `baseVersions` no longer match) or `too-large` (the workbook's metadata would exceed the storage limit).

### Replace a whole sheet

For bulk imports, `sheetReplacements` is more efficient than sending many individual cell operations:

```js
await gadget.applyOperation({
  senderId: "csv-import",
  sheetReplacements: [{
    sheetId,
    cells: {
      A1: { value: "Name", fmt: { b: true }, version: 1 },
      B1: { value: "Total", fmt: { b: true }, version: 1 },
      A2: { value: "Example", fmt: null, version: 1 },
      B2: { value: "1250", fmt: { nf: "currency", d: 2 }, version: 1 },
    },
  }],
});
```

A whole-sheet replacement overwrites that sheet's complete cell map, so merge with existing data first if it must be preserved. To have it refused if the sheet changed after you read it, pass `baseVersions`: every cell's `version` from that read, keyed by reference. The server stores every replaced cell at a new version, higher than any the sheet held, and returns the stored cells in `result.replacedCells`; use those versions for later edits. A cell operation in the same call is applied on top of the replacement, against the versions it carried.

### Change workbook structure

Pass a structure update to change the title, sheet order, names, dimensions, or sizing metadata. Fields and sheets the update leaves out keep their stored values; `sheetOrder`, when sent, sets the order of the sheets it lists. Structure is last-writer-wins per field, so start with the latest document:

```js
const doc = await gadget.getDocument();
const sheetId = doc.sheetOrder[0];

await gadget.applyOperation({
  senderId: "setup-script",
  structure: {
    title: "Quarterly plan",
    sheets: {
      [sheetId]: {
        name: "Summary",
        colWidths: { ...doc.sheets[sheetId].colWidths, 0: 180 },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To add sheets, list their IDs in `addedSheets` and their metadata in `sheets`; each gets empty cell storage. To delete sheets and their stored cells, list their IDs in `removedSheets`; the last sheet cannot be deleted. A sheet omitted from `sheetOrder` is kept and moved to the end, and an unknown ID in it is ignored. When a structure was sent, `result.structure` is the structure the server now holds. When adding a sheet and its initial data together, include both `structure` and a matching `sheetReplacements` entry in the same operation.

Sheet metadata may also carry a `filter` (header row, end row, filter columns, per-column selected values, the pre-sort row order and the active sort), `charts` (type, A1 data range, titles, header/label/legend flags and pixel position), `comments` (cell reference, text, creation time and resolved flag) and, on a pivot sheet, `pivot` (source sheet and range, row/column/value fields, aggregate, totals and filter). Send `filter: null` or `pivot: null` to remove one. The server validates all of them on every read and write: a chart or pivot range is clamped to its sheet and emptied past 200,000 cells, a sheet keeps at most 50 charts, comments are cut at 4,000 characters, and malformed entries are dropped. The whole workbook's metadata shares one storage value, so an update that would push it past the limit, and grow it, is rejected.

Formatting keys accepted by the server are `b` (bold), `i` (italic), `u` (underline), `s` (strikethrough), `c` (text color), `bg` (fill color), `a` (`l`, `c`, or `r` alignment), `nf` (number format), `d` (decimal places), `fs` (font size), and `wrap`. Colors must be hexadecimal strings such as `#1d1d20`.

## Architecture

Both sides are built on the shared gadget libraries in `packages/bundled-blueprints/libraries`, which the build
inlines into the `client.js` and `server.js` it ships.

`@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/ui/client` draws the chrome: the element builder, the shared
toolbar icons and controls (icon and segment buttons, groups, colour pickers, the dropdown behind the
number-format menu), the in-page prompt that stands in for the `window.prompt` the sandbox blocks,
and the save-status dot. `@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/sync/client` and `.../sync/server` are the
collaboration loop: the debounced, serialized, retrying save scheduler, the presence roster and
heartbeat, the subscriber object the server calls back on, and in the Durable Object the mutation
queue and the subscriber registry with its presence announcements (whose broadcasts are never
awaited, so a callback may re-enter the queue). The cell model, the formula engine, the grid, the
sheet tabs and the exports are this gadget's own.

In the repository the source is TypeScript under `blueprints/workspace-sheets/files/`
(`client.ts`, `server.ts`, `lib/protocol.ts`, `lib/limits.ts`, `lib/formula.ts`, `lib/xlsx.ts`, `lib/zip.ts`), which the build bundles
into the `client.js` and `server.js` shipped here.

### `client.js`

Builds the entire browser interface in JavaScript. It contains:

- Grid rendering and selection behavior
- Cell editing, formatting, sorting, and structural operations
- Formula tokenization, parsing, evaluation, and display formatting
- Clipboard and keyboard support
- Filter rows, charts (rendered as SVG), cell comments, pivot tables and the sidebar that edits them
- Formula assistance: autocomplete, syntax hints, reference picking and validation
- A local model whose saves are queued per cell and flushed by the library's scheduler; structure is sent as the fields this tab changed, and a remote structure change is merged with this tab's pending one field by field (charts and comments item by item)
- RPC callbacks for live server operations and presence events

Formula evaluation happens in the browser. The engine caches computed cells, detects circular references, supports ranges and cross-sheet references, and displays standard errors including `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, `#REF!`, `#NAME?`, `#N/A`, `#NUM!`, and `#CYCLE!`.

### `server.js`

Exports the Durable Object class `Gadget`, which is the authoritative persistence and synchronization layer. It:

- Stores spreadsheet metadata and each sheet's cells in Durable Object storage
- Serializes mutations and document snapshots through the library's mutation queue
- Applies per-cell optimistic concurrency using cell versions
- Uses last-writer-wins semantics for document structure, per field, and refuses a sheet replacement built on cells that have since changed
- Broadcasts operations and presence events through the library's subscriber registry after the queue releases, best-effort and without awaiting them, so a callback may itself read or write the document and a hung subscriber holds up only its own client
- Sanitizes titles, dimensions, cell contents, references, formatting, filters, charts, comments, and pivot settings
- Advertises and produces the server-side workbook and CSV exports

### XLSX and ZIP modules (bundled into `server.js`)

The XLSX module converts a complete document snapshot into a streaming XLSX workbook: sparse
worksheet XML with inline strings, deduplicated styles, frozen panes, autofilters, hyperlinks,
legacy-note comments (with their VML shapes) and DrawingML charts. The ZIP module is a
dependency-free streaming ZIP writer (raw DEFLATE via `CompressionStream`, incremental CRC32, data
descriptors). Both are bundled into `server.js`.

## Storage model

The server stores:

- `meta`: revision, title, sheet order, sheet metadata (including filters, charts, comments and pivot settings), and modification time
- `cells:<sheetId>`: a map of A1 references to `{ value, fmt, version }`

Default sheets have 100 rows and 26 columns. Server validation permits up to 50,000 rows and 702 columns per sheet. Cell values are limited to 8,192 characters, and titles are limited to 200 characters.

## Collaboration notes

The server and client synchronization code support multiple connected clients and live updates. Each
tab introduces itself with the guest name and colour the sync library derives from its client ID, and
reports its selected range on the library's throttle and heartbeat. Remote collaborator badges and
selection overlays are currently disabled in the UI, so the app presents as a single-user spreadsheet
even though remote operations still synchronize.

## Current limitations

- There is no file import workflow; clipboard operations use tab-separated text.
- Structural edits, sorting, and a cut that moves comments clear local undo/redo history; a collaborator rearranging a sheet (sorting, inserting or deleting rows) drops the history for that sheet, along with any unsaved edits to it.
- Edits, fills, pastes and copies skip rows hidden by a filter, as in Excel.
- A collaborator's edit made before a sort reached them is refused where a cell now stands, but lands in a position the sort emptied.
- Sorting moves formulas with their rows and shifts their relative references, as Excel does.
- Formula reference adjustment during row/column changes is limited to references on the current sheet; chart ranges and pivot sources on the edited sheet move with it.
- Formula support is broad but is not intended to be fully compatible with Excel or Google Sheets.
- A formula with anything left after a complete expression (a `;` separator, an extra `)`, Excel's space intersection operator) shows `#VALUE!`; the XLSX export may still write it as a formula.
- Frozen row/column metadata exists in the model, but the current UI does not expose controls for it.

## CSV export

Up to 31 worksheets are exposed as individual **CSV** export options, leaving one of the platform's
32 format slots for XLSX. CSV files contain the stored cell values through the worksheet's used
range. Formula cells are exported as their raw formulas (for example, `=SUM(A1:A10)`), not as
browser-computed display values. Fields use standard CSV quoting and CRLF line endings.

## XLSX export

**Excel Workbook** exports one XLSX file with the worksheets in workbook order. Cells keep their
font, color, fill, alignment, number format, decimal places and wrapping; sheets keep column widths,
row heights and frozen panes. Pixel sizes are converted to points (rows, fonts) or approximate
character widths (columns), so layout is close but not pixel-identical.

Cell values follow the grid's own literal rules: a leading apostrophe forces text, a leading `=` is
a formula (whatever the number format), `TRUE`/`FALSE` are booleans, and numbers may carry a sign,
commas, a leading `$` or a trailing `%`. Everything else is text; date-looking text is not parsed.

Formulas are written without cached results and the workbook requests a full recalculation on open,
so Excel evaluates them itself. To keep them valid there, the exporter rewrites cross-sheet
references to the exported worksheet names, converts single-quoted string literals
(`'Complete'`) to Excel's double-quote form, prefixes OOXML "future functions" (`IFS`, `CONCAT`, ...)
with `_xlfn.`, renames `ERRORTYPE()` to `ERROR.TYPE()`, and drops whitespace between a function
name and its `(`. A formula that is empty, structurally unbalanced (unterminated string or quoted
name, mismatched parentheses or brackets — the grid completes a missing `)`) or that would exceed
Excel's 8,192-character limit after rewriting is exported as text, since one such formula makes
Excel report the whole workbook as damaged. Formula semantics are otherwise not translated (for
example `^` associativity differs, and a reference outside the grid such as `XFE1` is empty here
but `#NAME?` in Excel), and compatibility with Excel is not claimed beyond this.

Worksheet names are made Excel-safe: invalid characters become `_`, blank names become `Sheet`,
names are cut to 31 characters, and case-insensitive collisions get ` (2)`, ` (3)`, ... suffixes.
References resolve to the first worksheet with a matching source name, as in the grid.

Cells whose literal text is an `http(s)` URL (unless formatted as text) become Excel hyperlinks with
the grid's link styling; `HYPERLINK()` formulas need no translation.

A filter row exports as an Excel autofilter over the same range, with dropdown buttons only on the
grid's filter columns, the sort indicator, and each column's selected values as filter criteria.
Sorting reorders the stored cells in the grid, so no reordering is needed here. Rows are hidden by
comparing the literal values in the criteria columns; a row whose criteria cell holds a formula stays
visible, since formulas are not evaluated here, and Excel's **Reapply** refilters it. Criteria are
written as the grid's raw values, so a formatted number (`$1,234.00`) may not match Excel's displayed
text until reapplied. A column with nothing selected hides every row, formulas included, but carries
no criteria.

Open comments export as Excel notes; resolved comments are hidden in the grid and omitted. Several
comments on one cell are joined into one note.

Charts export as native Excel charts of the same type (line, area, pie, stacked bar) over the same
range, reading headers and labels the way the grid does, with the grid's palette, titles, axis titles
and legend setting. As in the grid, a column with no numeric value is not a series - a column holding
formulas is kept, since they are not evaluated here - and Excel's limit of 255 series applies to the
columns that remain. Series reference the worksheet directly, so Excel computes them on open. A chart
is positioned at the cell under its grid coordinates, at the same pixel size. Charts without a usable
data range or series are skipped.

Pivot tables export as their materialized output cells (with their formatting), not as Excel pivot
tables: the pivot's source definition is dropped and the values no longer refresh.
